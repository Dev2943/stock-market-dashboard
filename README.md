## 📈 Methodology & Approach

### Risk Assessment Framework

My proprietary risk scoring system was developed during my MS in Business Analytics program at UMass Amherst, combining traditional financial metrics with modern quantitative methods.

**Why These Weights?**
- **Volatility (30%)** - Primary driver of portfolio risk; directly impacts position sizing
- **Momentum (25%)** - Recent price action predicts near-term behavior; crucial for timing
- **Liquidity (20%)** - Affects execution quality and slippage; critical for larger positions
- **Technical (15%)** - Overbought/oversold extremes signal reversals; momentum confirmation
- **Drawdown (10%)** - Historical worst-case scenarios; tail risk assessment

**Risk Categories:**
```
0-20   → Very Low Risk (Conservative investors)
20-35  → Low Risk (Moderate-conservative investors)
35-50  → Moderate Risk (Balanced investors)
50-70  → High Risk (Growth-oriented investors)
70-100 → Very High Risk (Aggressive investors only)
```

### Auto-Refresh Architecture

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Session state management
if 'last_refresh_time' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.last_refresh_time = datetime.now()

# Calculate time elapsed
time_since_refresh = (datetime.now() - st.session_state.last_refresh_time).total_seconds()

# Auto-refresh when 30 seconds pass
if time_since_refresh >= 30:
    st.cache_data.clear()
    st.rerun()
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Uses session state instead of `time.sleep()`
- ✅ **User control**: Toggle on/off anytime
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: Live countdown timer
- ✅ **Manual override**: Force refresh button
- ✅ **State persistence**: Tracks refresh history

### Forecasting Approach

**Hybrid Methodology:**

1. **Historical Momentum (70% weight)**
   - 30-day price momentum captures recent trend strength
   - More reliable than pure ML for near-term predictions
   - Grounded in actual market behavior

2. **ML Prediction (30% weight)**
   - Trend analysis with mean reversion principles
   - Volatility-adjusted for realistic scenarios
   - Adds forward-looking perspective

3. **Confidence Intervals (85% CI)**
   - Acknowledges inherent market uncertainty
   - Helps with risk management decisions
   - Based on historical volatility patterns

**Important Note:** Forecasts are for educational purposes. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

## 🔍 What Makes This Project Unique

### 1. **Production-Ready Auto-Refresh** ⚡ NEW!
Unlike typical demo dashboards, this implements:
- Non-blocking auto-refresh using Streamlit session state
- Live countdown timer for user feedback
- Toggle control for user preference
- Refresh statistics tracking
- Professional UX with manual override option

This demonstrates production-level thinking beyond just analytics.

### 2. **Original Risk Scoring Methodology** ⭐
Unlike standard technical analysis tools, I developed a proprietary weighted scoring system based on academic research and industry best practices. The 5-factor model with specific weights (30/25/20/15/10) was calibrated during my MS coursework.

### 3. **Smart API Integration**
Real-world implementation of external API with:
- 30-second smart caching (balances freshness vs efficiency)

- Dual-mode architecture for flexibility

### 4. **Cross-Domain Application**
Applied category analysis techniques from luxury retail (Andor Luxury) to financial sector analysis, demonstrating ability to transfer analytical frameworks across industries.

### 5. **Risk-First Philosophy**
Every recommendation considers risk score first, preventing high-risk buys even with positive technical signals - reflecting real-world investment discipline.

### 6. **Educational Transparency**
All methodologies are documented and explained, demonstrating not just technical skills but ability to communicate complex concepts clearly.
